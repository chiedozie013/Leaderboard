# Leaderboard
This is a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I first developed a working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality, then I  consumed the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and added some styling.
